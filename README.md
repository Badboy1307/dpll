I'd like to [post](http://zipcpu.com) about some simple and some basic
[Phase Locked Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop) algorithms.
To do this I'm going to need some demo code, which I'll keep in this repository.

## Blog posts

I expect a couple of [blog posts](http://zipcpu.com) coming up on this
topic.  For now, I'll probably post first about:

1. How to build a [Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerically_controlled_oscillator) within an [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array).

2. I can then present the [first simple PLL](rtl/sdpll.v), and it might
   even make sense to those who read it.

This is all if the [Lord is
willing](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15/).
