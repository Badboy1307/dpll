I'd like to [post](http://zipcpu.com) about some simple and some basic
[Phase Locked Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop) algorithms.
To do this I'm going to need some demo code, which I'll keep in this repository.

## Blog posts

I recently [posted](http://zipcpu.com) two articles describing the components
of a basic [PLL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop), and hence
the implementation found in this repository.  These are:

1. [How to build a Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO)](http://zipcpu.com/dsp/2017/12/09/nco.html) within an [FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array).

2. [The Logic PLL](http://zipcpu.com/dsp/2017/12/14/logic-pll.html) based upon the code in [rtl/sdpll.v](rtl/sdpll.v).

If the [Lord is
willing](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jas/4/15/), I may go deeper
and describe some other 
[PLL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop) implementations as
well--such as the sample time tracking PLL that I recently added.
